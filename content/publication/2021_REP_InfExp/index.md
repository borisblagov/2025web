abstract: Do inflation expectations react to changes in the volatility of monetary policy? Yes, but only until the global financial crisis. This paper investigates whether increasing the dispersion of monetary policy shocks, which is interpreted as elevated uncertainty surrounding monetary policy, affects the inflation expectation formation process. Based on U.S. data since the 1980s and a stochastic volatility-in-mean structural VAR model we find that monetary policy uncertainty reduces both inflation expectations and inflation. However, after the Great Recession this link has disappeared, even when controlling for the Zero Lower Bound.


# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary:  In this paper we study whether inflation expectations in the U.S. react to changes in monetary policy uncertainty (MPU) as measured through the volatility of monetary policy shocks. We find that while they did, the importance of MPU has diminished and that it has different effects on short versus long-term inflation expectations.
