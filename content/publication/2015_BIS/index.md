abstract: Using  a  Markov-switching  VAR  with  endogenous transition  probabilities, we  analyse  what has triggered the interest rate pass-through impairment for Italy, Ireland, Spain and Portugal. We  find  that  global  risk  factors  have  contributed  to  higher  lending  rates  in  Italy  and  Spain, problems in the banking sector help to explain the impairment in Spain, and fiscal problems and  contagion  effects  have  contributed in Italy and Ireland. We also find that the ECBâ€™s unconventional  monetary  policy  announcements  have  had  temporary  positive  effects  in  Italy. Due  to  the  zero  lower  bound  these  findings  are  amplified  if  EONIA  is  used  as  a  measure  of the policy rate. We did not detect changes in the monetary policy transmission for Portugal.
