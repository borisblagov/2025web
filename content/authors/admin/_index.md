## About Me

I am an economist and a professional forecaster for [RWI -- Leibniz Institute of Economic Research](http://en.rwi-essen.de/)  in Essen, Germany at the division [Macroeconomics and Public Finance](http://en.rwi-essen.de/forschung-und-beratung/wachstum-konjunktur-oeffentliche-finanzen/).

I am part of the junior faculty of the [Ruhr Graduate School of Economics](http://rgs-econ.org/) and a research fellow of [DocMA](https://docma.tu-dortmund.de/team/research-fellows/) - an interdisciplinary research project in which algorithms process huge amounts of newspaper articles and texts of social media in order to recognize patterns.

On this page you will find my [research](/#papers), [forecasts](/#forecasts), [replication codes](/#publications), and previous [teaching materials](#teaching).
