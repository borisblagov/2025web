I will be attending [ICEEE 2019](https://www.side-iea.it/events/iceee/iceee-2019) conference in Lecce, Italy where I will present my paper [Exchange rate uncertainty and import prices in the euro area](/publication/2018_eru/) on **Friday, the 25-th**. My talk will take place in **Room 3** of Building 6 (Campus Studium 2000) in the session from **14:30 to 16:10**.

I have created a calendar `.ics` file which mimics page 3 from the [program](https://www.side-iea.it/sites/side-iea.it/files/iceee2019lecce_final_program.pdf). You may import it in your calendar app and add the Rooms to the sessions that you want to attend. The events have _no_ notifications by default.

Download the .ics [here](ICEEE2019.ics).

After you have successfully imported it should look like this:
